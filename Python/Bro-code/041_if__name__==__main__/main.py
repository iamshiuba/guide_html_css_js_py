# if __name__ == __main__: (this script can be imported OR run standalone)
#                           functions and classes in this module can be reused
#                           without the main block of code executing
#                           Good practice (Code is modular, helps readability,
#                           leaves no global variables, avoid unintended execution)
#                           ex: library = import library for functionality
